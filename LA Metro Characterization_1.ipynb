    "Driving in Los Angeles (LA) traffic could be a daunting task for tourists or people who are staying in LA for only a short while. Not only does LA have the worst traffic in the US (according to CBS news), but also confusing traffic layouts and road surfaces in dire disrepair. With LA being one of the host cities of World Cup 2026 and the host city of 2028 Olympics, it is clear that LA metro will be playing a major role in transporting tourists. \n",

    "Therefore, the characterization of the metro lines would be of great interest to tourists and local businesses alike. In this study, we are looking to characterize the metro lines by the venues surrounding the metro stations. For tourists, this study provides an idea of what venues to expect along the metro lines. For businesses, this study presents an opportunities to find a niche along the lines and avoid areas where competition is overly saturated. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this study, we will focus our efforts on studying the metro lines that pass through the city of LA, namely, the Red, the Gold and the Expo lines. "
